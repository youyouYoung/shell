# Live edit and locked edits

## Live edit

You might have noticed that you can pretty much edit anything in this space. This is because the space is in what's know as **live edit** mode. In this mode, anyone who has permission can edit the content directly. This is great for early-days use. It is great for quick changes. No need for complex workflows.

At some point, you may reach a greater level of maturity with your content. That's when you may need some of the more powerful workflow features in GitBookâ€¦

## Locked edits

The alternative to a live edit mode is called **locked edits**. Spaces that are locked for live edits aren't directly editable, and any edits you need to make must be handled through **change requests**. You can lock a space using the space menu and selecting 'Lock live edits'.
