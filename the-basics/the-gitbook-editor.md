# The GitBook editor

Everything you've read so far has been in the **editor**. This window right here is where all your page content comes together.

## Block-based

The Editor is full of all sorts of content blocks, like this hint:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Check me out!** Iâ€™m an editable 'hint' block, and I think I look pretty great ðŸ’…
{% endhint %}

You can access the block list at any time by hitting `CMD + /` (`CTRL + /` on Windows) to bring up a filterable list of blocks. Or you can check out our documentation for a full list of blocks with examples.

## A note on markdown

While the editor supports most common Markdown decorators, behind the scenes, GitBook is converting this to a document format that works with our block-based editor.
