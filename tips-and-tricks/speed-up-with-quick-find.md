# Speed up with quick find

If you haven't already, give that `CMD + K` (`CTRL + K` on Windows) shortcut a little tap.

Cool, right? This is our quick find palette, and it's super useful if you need to jump between content quickly.

If this is your first time using GitBook, you probably don't have a whole bunch of content right now. Once you start filling it with spaces and collections and all the wonderful content you're creating, you're gonna need a quick way to navigate through it all. Quick find will let you search for spaces, pages and content within pages; and navigate directly to them with a few keypresses. Get used to that shortcut!
