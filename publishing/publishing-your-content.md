# Publishing your content

GitBook makes publishing lovely docs a breeze. Hit the ‘Share’ button up top, select ‘Publish’, configure a few settings and you're good to go!

There are a bunch of options for publishing – not everything has to go straight to the entire world. If you need to know more about the different types of publishing, you can check out detailed documentation over at the Publishing section of the GitBook docs.
